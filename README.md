Title: Employee Management System

Description:
This project is an Employee Management System developed using Java and MySQL. 
It provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to manage employee details efficiently.
With this system, administrators can perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records.

Update Employee Details: Administrators can update employee information, such as name, phone number, and email, as needed.
Delete Employee: Unnecessary employee records can be easily deleted from the system, ensuring data integrity.

Technology Stack:
Java: The core programming language used for developing the system's functionality.
MySQL: The relational database management system used to store and manage employee data.
Swing: The Java GUI toolkit used to create a user-friendly interface.

This project serves as an efficient solution for organizations to streamline their employee management processes.
By automating tasks such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting employee records, it simplifies administrative operations and enhances data management.
